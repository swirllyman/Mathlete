# Car Comparer 🚗

Overlay two cars at true scale and see whether the new one fits your garage,
and by how much, on every side.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the full design and roadmap.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev     # http://localhost:5173
npm test        # the fit/compare maths
npm run build
```

## What's here (Phase 1 + early Phase 2)

- **Top / Side / Front** overlays, drawn in millimetres with a flat
  (orthographic) projection, with signed differences on every side. Line the
  cars up by rear bumpers, front bumpers or centres.
- **3D** orbit view: the same cars as extruded bodies, sized exactly to spec.
- **Garage**: enter your garage and where your car sits, then see the new car
  parked in the same spot with the clearance to every wall and obstacle,
  room to open each door, whether the garage door closes, and the
  doorway width/height when driving in. Drag the car to re-park it.
- **Edit dimensions** on any car, or add your own. Tape-measured numbers for
  your own car beat any spec sheet.
- Everything is saved in the browser on this device.

## Where the numbers come from

`src/data/cars.ts` is a small starter list gathered from published spec
summaries. Mirror widths are the least reliable figure: where one is missing
the app estimates it and marks it `est.` Widths default to **mirrors out**.

## Layout

```
src/geometry/   pure maths: units, compare, fit, car silhouettes (unit-tested)
src/components/ SVG drawings, garage view, forms
src/scene/      three.js 3D view (lazy-loaded)
src/data/       car data, types, saved state
```
